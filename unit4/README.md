# Unit 4: Documentation
In unit 4, you will learn how to semi-automatically generate a documentation for your code, and what you need for a good documentation. Documenting your software is crucial if you want to attract users and collaborators.

If you run into problems at any point, please contact us via inga.ulusoy@uni-heidelberg.de or [open an issue on github](https://github.com/ssciwr/sustainable_development_course/issues).

The slides for this session are found [here](./unit4_SSD_SSC.pdf). The demonstrations are listed [here](./DEMONSTRATIONS.md) and the necessary commands for the live lession are summarized [here](./STEPS.md).

# 1. Unit 4, Part 1
we will learn about the importance and ingredients of a good documentation.

# 2. readthedocs
Please create a user account on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/).

# 3. GitHub pages
Please complete the learning lab on [how to set up GitHub pages](https://classroom.github.com/a/8HLdEW04).

# 4. Synchronous and asynchronous work in your team
Set up sphinx for your package. You will commit the changes under the account of one team member, however it is encouraged that all of you try to set up sphinx locally on your computer. You may use [this repo](https://classroom.github.com/a/e-RvSMt4) as a reference.
Continue to develop your documentation into something that is worth showing others. Look at the other team's documentations and identify aspects that raise your interest for their software.
