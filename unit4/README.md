# Unit 4: Documentation
In unit 4, you will learn how to semi-automatically generate a documentation for your code, and what you need for a good documentation. Documenting your software is crucial if you want to attract users and collaborators.

If you run into problems at any point, please contact us via inga.ulusoy@uni-heidelberg.de or [open an issue on github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue).

# 1. Video: Unit 4
Please watch the [video]() to learn about the importance and ingredients of a good documentation.

# 2. Example documentation
Set up the sphinx documentation on either [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/)(RTD) or [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for your example code - computation of the factorial - from unit 3.

# 3. Live lesson
During the live lesson, you will set up the documentation for your python package together with your team.

# 4. Asynchronous work in your team
Continue to develop your documentation into something that is worth showing others. Look at the other team's documentations and identify aspects that raise your interest for their software.
