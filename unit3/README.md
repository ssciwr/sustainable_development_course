# Unit 3: Testing, testing, testing ... and writing good documentation
In unit 3, you will learn about types of tests, and implement unit tests for your developed python module. We will also continue to work on the documentation and publish it on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/).

If you run into problems at any point, please contact us via inga.ulusoy@uni-heidelberg.de or [open an issue on github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue).

# 1. Video: Unit 3, Part 1
Please watch the [video](https://youtu.be/11t1EGV3V3I) to learn about the importance of software testing, types of software tests, test-driven development and the unittest module.

# 2. Write your own unit test in the unittest framework
Write an example function in python that is to be tested using unittest and different assert methods, as explained in the video. Try what happens if your test fails.

# 3. Video: Unit 2, Part 2
Please watch the [video](https://youtu.be/eSIygwMcK24) - you will learn about pytest unit tests and what to include in a good documentation.

# 4. Quiz
Answer the [questions](https://forms.gle/b5Mn9Q7gs1EugViJ8) (this is strictly anonymous).

# 5. Live lesson
We will meet on Thursday, March 25th at 12:30 - 3:00 PM for the live lesson via the previous link. In addition to that, I have sent you a youtube link for live streaming - please keep both open during the session.

During the lesson, we will use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), [recommonmark](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html).

# 6. Asynchronous work in your team
Continue working on your module(s) during the week and complete the pytest test suite and documentation. Collaborate through GitHub, and use branches, pull request, and request reviews from your team members before merging any branches into main.

# 7. Evaluation of unit 3
This is not mandatory, but we would highly appreciate your feedback. Please help us by [answering a couple of questions](https://forms.gle/myvRaYH7xTocHp1WA).
