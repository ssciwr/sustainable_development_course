# Unit 1: Introduction to git: Using git and GitHub

In unit 1, you will learn and practice the git basics. Before we start, there are a few items that you will need to work through, to ensure your computer is set up with everything we need for the course. See the steps to do so [here](PREPARATION.md).

If you run into problems at any point, please contact us via inga.ulusoy@uni-heidelberg.de or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ssciwr/sustainable_development_course/issues) (see [how to create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)).

The slides for this session are found [here](./unit1_SSD_SSC.pdf). The demonstrations are listed [here](./DEMONSTRATIONS.md) and the necessary commands for the live lession are summarized [here](./STEPS.md).
