# Unit 2: Clean coding as a team: Adhere to guidelines and common coding principles

In unit 2, you will practice planning of a piece of software, and collaboratively develop a python package (python modules) using GitHub and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

If you run into problems at any point, please contact us via inga.ulusoy@uni-heidelberg.de or [open an issue on github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue).

# 1. Video: Unit 2, Part 1
Please watch the [video](https://youtu.be/TSQjcPAJ9Ds).

# 2. Sketch your module
On a piece of paper, sketch out the data flow in your python module(s). Do this without your team, only considering your pieces, while you still want to keep it as general as possible as you already know that other pieces will be added to it.

# 3. Video: Unit 2, Part 2
Please watch the [video](https://youtu.be/AoDFzRTS8jQ) - this tells you how to install an IDE, in this case Visual Studio Code OR Atom, and explains the basic functionality of the IDE.

# 4. Quiz
Answer the [questions](https://forms.gle/NXypPT3QbC33NDiW6) (this is strictly anonymous).

# 5. Live lesson
We will meet on Thursday, March 18th at 12:30 - 3:00 PM for the live lesson via the previous link. If you experienced issues with wonder, and cannot solve them, please let me know.

During the lesson, we will use [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), [recommonmark](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/).

# 6. Asynchronous work in your team
Continue working on your module(s) during the week and complete the implementation. Collaborate through GitHub, and use branches, pull request, and request reviews from your team members before merging any branches into main.

# 7. Evaluation of unit 2
This is not mandatory, but we would highly appreciate your feedback. Please help us by [answering a couple of questions](https://forms.gle/btaafmAo97Zr1Zd3A).
