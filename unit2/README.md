# Unit 2: Clean coding as a team: Adhere to guidelines and common coding principles

In unit 2, you will practice collaborative software development using git, GitHub and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), and learn about clean coding and best principles.

If you run into problems at any point, please contact us via inga.ulusoy@uni-heidelberg.de or [open an issue on github](https://github.com/ssciwr/sustainable_development_course/issues).

The slides for this session are found [here](./unit2_SSD_SSC.pdf). The demonstrations are listed [here](./DEMONSTRATIONS.md) and the necessary commands for the live lession are summarized [here](./STEPS.md).

# 1. Video: Unit 2, Part 1
Please watch the [video](https://youtu.be/OqqM6NETPg0) to learn about technical debt, coding best practices and Python style guides.

# 2. Style Guides
Go to the [PEP-8 style guide](https://pep8.org/) and read through these sections: [Code Layout](https://pep8.org/#code-lay-out), [Naming Conventions](https://pep8.org/#naming-conventions). You may read more or also peruse the [google recommendations](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

The recommendations for naming, especially naming of modules, is very important if you want to publish your package in the Python Package Index PyPI.

# 3. Working with an IDE
Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another IDE of your choice. Work through this [page about VSCode with Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).

# 5. Live lesson
We will meet on Wednesday, March 1st at 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM for the live lesson via the previous link. 

# 6. Asynchronous work in your team
Continue working on your Notebooks. Collaborate through GitHub, and use branches, pull request, and request reviews from your team members before merging any branches into main.
