# Changes for next time teaching this course

## General
Teaming up from the get-go can lead to incompetent teams (team members that are very active and others that are not). Ideally have a pre-team week with a task that helps to identify the active participants so that those can be grouped together; maybe also group postdocs together: and only those that ask for a certificate (though the last two items are no guarantee).

## Unit 1
- have a small example directory that each participant can add to GitHub individually
- split the live session in two 2h-sessions
- explain some more on the background of git
