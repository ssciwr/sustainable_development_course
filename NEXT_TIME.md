# Changes for next time teaching this course

## General
Teaming up from the get-go can lead to incompetent teams (team members that are very active and others that are not). Ideally have a pre-team week with a task that helps to identify the active participants so that those can be grouped together; maybe also group postdocs together: and only those that ask for a certificate (though the last two items are no guarantee).

Have pre-complete repo after each life session, in addition to the complete repo after each week that is already included.

Include a list of required commands during the live session.

More explanations on the installs (shift workload outside live session).

## Unit 1
- have a small example directory that each participant can add to GitHub individually
- split the live session in two 2h-sessions
- explain some more on the background of git

## Unit 2
- be quicker with the example repo so that participants can compare the sphinx settings themselves
- more on python modules and packages in the video, plus explain naming conventions in video
