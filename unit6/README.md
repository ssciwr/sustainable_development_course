# Unit 6: Continuous integration - GitHub actions
In unit 6, you will learn about GitHub actions and how to publish a Python package in the Python package index, [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

When you publish your package, it can be pip installed and then used in ie. jupyter notebooks or more complex software.

Please look [here](PUBLISH.md) for a few notes on how to publish scientific software.

If you run into problems at any point, please contact us via inga.ulusoy@uni-heidelberg.de or [open an issue on github](https://github.com/ssciwr/sustainable_development_course/issues).

The slides for this session are found [here](./unit6_SSD_SSC.pdf). The necessary commands for the live lession are listed [here](./STEPS.md).

# 1. Unit 6, Part 1
We will learn about the basics of GitHub actions and publishing Python packages.

# 2. Try out GitHub actions
Use the [assignment repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/SV9eEuQO) to try out GitHub actions.
Try creating branches, opening pull requests and manually triggering the workflow to see when it runs. Look at the output of the runs and try to follow the steps. 

# 3. Publishing a Python package: Optional
Follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) to learn how to publish a python package and what you need to consider (ie., [proper naming](https://visualgit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/naming_convention.html) of your package and modules). You can use [this repo](https://classroom.github.com/a/x0Da-iot) for your reference.

# 4. Synchronous and asynchronous work in your team
Continue working on your packages and complete the pytest test suite and sphinx documentation, as well as the set-up for GitHub actions. Collaborate through GitHub, and use branches, pull request, and request reviews from your team members before merging any branches into main.
