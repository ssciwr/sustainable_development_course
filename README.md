#  Block course: Sustainable Software Development

**The Art of Developing Scientific Software: What do you need to make your
software fly?**

*Scientific Software Center, Heidelberg University*  
*01/2021*  

In this course, you will learn how to develop scientific software in a way that enables reproducible research and sustainable software. Sustainable scientific software leaves room for further, subsequent implementations and method development, and saves time and effort in the long run; in addition to adhering to good scientific practice through making results reproducible. This course is aimed at researchers, doctoral and master
students who develop scientific software to carry out their research.
The course will contain four units spanning four weeks, and consist of both an asynchronous and a synchronous part.  

**Total effort:** Approximately 6 hours/week.  
**Date/Duration:**
Sessions for the first block course will take place on Tuesday, March 11./18./25./30. with live lecture/discussion from
12:30-3:00 PM and independent work to be completed between sessions.

You will be able to obtain a certificate of participation. Basic prior programming knowledge is a requirement, ideally in python as the examples will be based on python. A laptop/PC with camera, microphone and speakers is required.


# Units
## 1. Introduction to git: Using github
[Go to unit 1](unit1/README.md)
1. Creating a new repository
1. Branching and pull requests
1. Code review and merging

In this unit, we will work on jupyter notebooks.

## 2. Clean coding as a team: Adhere to guidelines and common coding principles
[Go to unit21](unit2/README.md)
1. The programming paradigm: Planning a piece of software
1. Technical debt and clean coding
1. Linting and performance of code
1. Documentation using sphinx (doxygen)
1. More on git: “Clean” repositories

A python module will be developed.

## 3. Testing, testing, testing ... and writing good documentation
[Go to unit 3](unit3/README.md)
1. Types of tests
1. Unittest and pytest
1. Test-driven development
1. A good documentation  

We will continue our work on the python module.

## 4. Continuous integration: github actions
1. Run your tests and linter automatically through github actions
1. Build and publish your documentation on readthedocs
1. Optionally: Publish your python module as a package  

Recap and presentation of the implementations/discussion lead by the developer teams.  
The python module will be completed.


## Content of each unit
- A recorded video introducing new topics and concepts (~30-45 minutes)
- Individual work on the new concepts (~45-60 minutes)
- A recap of last week’s tasks and discussion of problems that occurred (live lecture, ~30 minutes)
- Tasks to be solved as teams of 2-3 developers (live lecture, ~2 hours)
- Tasks to be solved during the week in the software development teams (each team member works asynchronously) (~2 hours)

## Requirements
You will need python3, git, and numpy/seaborn/pandas/jupyter for the course.
