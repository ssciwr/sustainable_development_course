#  Block course: Scientific Software Development

**Scientific Software Development**

*Scientific Software Center, Heidelberg University*  
*01/2021*  

In this course, you will learn how to develop scientific software in a way that enables reproducible research and sustainable software. Sustainable scientific software leaves room for further, subsequent implementations and method development, and saves time and effort in the long run; in addition to adhering to good scientific practice through making results reproducible. This course is aimed at researchers, doctoral and master
students who develop scientific software to carry out their research.
The course will contain four units spanning four weeks, and consist of both an asynchronous and a synchronous part.  

**Total effort:** Approximately 30 hours.  
**Date/Duration:**
Sessions will take place in six sessions during two weeks in March 2022: Specifically, on 1/3/22, 2/3/22, 3/3/22, 8/3/22,9/3/22,10/3/22, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Please note that there is also an asynchronous part to the course, which you can work on at a time of your choice, but which should be completed before the first/before the subsequent session for a better learning experience. 

You will be able to obtain a certificate of participation. Basic prior programming knowledge is a requirement, but the emphasis lies on **basic**; ideally in python as the examples will be based on python. A laptop/PC with camera, microphone and speakers is required.


# Units
## 1. Introduction to git: Using git and GitHub
[Go to unit 1](unit1/README.md)
1. Git basics
1. Jupyter notebook basics
1. Creating a new repository
1. Pre-commit hooks
1. Creating branches
1. Merging branches

In this unit, we will work on jupyter notebooks in our own repositories on GitHub.

## 2. Clean coding as a team: Adhere to guidelines and common coding principles
[Go to unit 2](unit2/README.md)
1. Technical debt and clean coding
1. Style guides
1. Linting and performance of code
1. More on git: “Clean” repositories
1. Pull requests
1. Code review and merging

You will work with your team in your team's repository and agree on a set of common standards and coding principles.

## 3. Think before you code: Planning your programming project
[Go to unit 3](unit3/README.md)
1. The programming paradigm
1. Planning a piece of software: Demonstrations

You and your team will plan your software and implement the design.

## 4. Documentation
[Go to unit 4](unit4/README.md)
1. A good documentation  
1. Documentation style guides
1. Set up your documentation with sphinx (doxygen)
1. Publish your documentation on readthedocs
1. Publish your documentation on GitHub pages

The documentation tools for your software will be set up and structured.

## 5. Testing, testing, testing ... 
[Go to unit 5](unit5/README.md)
1. Types of tests
1. Unittest and pytest
1. Test-driven development
1. Writing unit tests using pytest fixtures

We will continue our work on the programming project.

## 6. Continuous integration: GitHub actions
[Go to unit 6](unit6/README.md)
1. GitHub actions basics
1. Run your tests and linter automatically through GitHub actions
1. Build and publish your documentation through GitHub actions
1. Publish your python module as a package  

We will set up github actions and you will learn how to publish python modules.

## Content of each unit
- An introduction to new topics and concepts (1h)
- Individual work on the new concepts (1h)
- A coding demonstration (1h)
- Tasks to be solved as teams of 2-3 developers (2h)

## Requirements
You will need python3, git, and numpy/seaborn/pandas/jupyter for the course.
